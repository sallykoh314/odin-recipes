    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I have never been a big fan of scones because I often found them too dry. 
            The thought of the dry scone getting caught in my troat steered me away from making scones. 
            What makes this scone different than others is the moistness of the pastry without taking away the crumbly characterists of a scone. 
            Not only that but the subtle flavors of the star anise and tumeric make this scone very pleasant and enjoyable.

            This recipes creates about 12 scones and they can be kept in the freezer portioned out. 
            To enjoy fresh baked scones, all you need to do is take them from the freezer and place them on the baking sheet and into the oven without thawing them out. 
            To top it off, make a simple glaze with powdered sugar and a little apricot soaking liquid and glaze the scone as soon as they come out of the oven.
