    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chocolate babkas are one of my favorite things to bake, and eat! 
            Babka is a sweet braided enriched Jewish bread that usually has layers of chocolate braided into the the bread. 
            But the filling doesn't always have to be chocolate, which makes room for creativity. 
            You can ass any filling you want, like pumpkin puree, apple butter, red bean paste, etc. 
            It is all up to the baker. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            This recipes yields about 3 large loaf pans or 6 mini loaf pans. 
            The fermentation process of the dough makes the process a little long but it is very worth it. 
            If you have left over babkas that has gone stale, you can always make french toat with them!
